# 🎬 IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques to classify IMDb movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**. It highlights the use of classical ML algorithms with feature extraction and evaluation metrics to analyze sentiment from unstructured text.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the sentiment polarity of movie reviews using NLP preprocessing and structured classification approaches.
